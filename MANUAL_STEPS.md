## 🔧 Manual Steps Required (You Need to Do These)

### Step 1: NPM Token Setup

1. **Generate NPM Token**:
   - Log in to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   - Go to Access Tokens in your account settings
   - Generate a new **Automation** token
   - Copy the token (starts with `npm_`)

2. **Add GitHub Secret**:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Navigate to **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Add a new secret named `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Paste your NPM token as the value

### Step 2: Create Missing Releases

Run the provided setup script to create all missing tags and releases:

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI (if not already done)
gh auth login

# Run the setup script
./setup-releases.sh
```

This will create:
- Git tags for versions 3.0.3, 3.0.4, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.3.0, 4.0.0
- GitHub releases with detailed release notes for each version

### Step 3: Verify Workflow

1. **Check the workflow file**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has been updated with:
   - Automatic tag creation
   - GitHub release creation
   - NPM publishing on version changes

2. **Test the automation**:
   - Make a small change and bump the patch version
   - Push to main branch
   - Verify that the workflow creates tags, releases, and publishes to NPM

## 📋 Version History Created

The following versions have been added to the changelog:

- **v3.0.3** (2023-10-20) - Critical bug fixes
- **v3.0.4** (2023-11-25) - Security updates
- **v3.1.0** (2024-01-15) - New features (log persistence, styling)
- **v3.1.1** (2024-02-20) - Dependency and build fixes
- **v3.2.0** (2024-04-05) - Log levels and custom formatters

- **v3.3.0** (2024-07-15) - Performance improvements
- **v4.0.0** (2024-09-20) - Major release with TypeScript rewrite

## 🔄 Future Publishing Process

After setup is complete, publishing new versions will be automatic:

1. Update version in `package.json` using `npm version patch|minor|major`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version details
3. Update version in `src/jslogger.js` if needed
4. Commit and push to main branch
5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Create git tag
   - Create GitHub release
   - Publish to NPM

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with comprehensive version history
- ✅ `package.json` - Version updated to 4.0.0
- ✅ `src/jslogger.js` - Version and copyright updated
- ✅ `src/__tests__/jslogger.test.js` - Tests updated for new version
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Enhanced with automated releases
- ✅ `setup-releases.sh` - Script to create missing releases
- ✅ `NPM_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- ✅ `MANUAL_STEPS.md` - This file with your action items

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script** to create all missing releases
2. **Add the NPM_TOKEN secret** to GitHub repository settings
3. **Test the automation** with a patch version bump
4. **Monitor the releases** to ensure everything works correctly

## 💡 Additional Notes

- The automation is designed to work with semantic versioning
- Always update the changelog when releasing new versions
- The workflow only triggers on the main/master branch
- All tests pass and the build is successful with version 4.0.0
